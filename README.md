### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Observed DNS and HTTP beaconing behaviors were mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
(T1071.004, T1071.001, T1046) using behavior-based analysis.
## Incident Response Workflow
This case study follows a standard SOC incident response lifecycle:
Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery.

The workflow demonstrates how suspicious DNS beaconing activity was detected,
contained, analyzed, and mitigated using a SOC-oriented approach.
